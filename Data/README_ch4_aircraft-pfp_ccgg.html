6. INTRODUCTION

Methane dry air mole fractions reported in these files were measured in air
samples collected at NOAA GML Carbon Cycle Aircraft Vertical Profile Network
sites and during aircraft campaigns. Since its inception in 1992, the Global
Greenhouse Gas Reference Network’s aircraft program has been dedicated to
collecting air samples in vertical profiles at sites mostly over North America.
The program's mission is to capture seasonal and inter-annual changes in trace
gas mixing ratios throughout the boundary layer and free troposphere (up to
8000m/26,000 ft). Most Aircraft Network flights collect 12 flask samples at
different fixed altitude levels using an automated Programmable Flask Package
(PFP). These samples are stored in glass flasks for later analysis of carbon
dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous xxide (N2O), methane (CH4),
molecular hydrogen (H2), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), as well as isotopes of
CO2 and CH4, and multiple halo- and hydrocarbons.

Data collected by the aircraft program provide a view of how the large-scale
horizontal and vertical distribution of the measured trace gases change
throughout a given year over the continent (Sweeney et al. 2015). The
large-scale, three-dimensional picture of how trace mixing ratios change
throughout the year has provided a means to estimate the contribution of the
North America continent to the atmospheric concentration of long-lived tracers
like carbonyl sulfide and CO2 (e.g. Montzka et al. 2007, Crevoisier et al.
2010) and serves as an essential benchmark for forward and inverse modeling
(i.e. Stephens et al. 2007, Yang et al. 2007, Peters et al. 2007) and to
calibrate and evaluate remote sensing retrievals (e.g. Wunch et al. 2010, Emmons
et al. 2004).

See https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/aircraft/ and Sweeney et al. 2015 for more
details.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA – MEASUREMENT METHODS

All samples were analyzed for CH4 at NOAA GML in Boulder, Colorado by gas
chromatography with flame ionization detection (prior to August 2019) or by
cavity ring-down spectroscopy (since August, 2019). Each sample aliquot was
referenced to the NOAA 2004A methane standard scale (see Dlugokencky et al.
2005, www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/ch4_scale.html). Measurements are reported
in units of nanomol/mol (10^-9 mol CH4 per mol of dry air (nmol/mol) or
parts per billion (ppb)).

Prior to August 2019, aliquots of sample and standard gas were injected into a
gas chromatograph (GC) with a sampling valve. Methane was separated from other
sample constituents using packed columns and detected using flame ionization
(FID). This process was highly automated for field and laboratory operations.
Instrument response of the sample was compared to a standard of known CH4
content. Repeatability of our measurements, based on repeated analysis of air
from a high-pressure cylinder, ranged from 1 to 3 nmol/mol over the period of
our measurements.

In August 2019, we switched from GC/FID to a cavity ring-down spectrometer that
analyzes CH4 and CO2. The analyzer is calibrated off-line with a suite of
standards once per month relative to a dry, natural air, reference in a
high-pressure cylinder. All air samples are measured relative the same
reference, and CH4 and CO2 values in measured samples are calculated based on
their ratio to the reference. Repeatability of the analyzer, based on repeated
analysis of air from a high-pressure cylinder, is ~0.2 ppb (1 sigma).

The uncertainty of our CH4 standard scale (NOAA 2004A) near 1800 ppb is
estimated at +/- 0.2%, or about 3 nmol/mol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3 DATA - FILE TYPE

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements
in two unique file formats; netCDF and ASCII text. 

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text (technically UTF-8 encoded) file is derived directly from the 
netCDF file.  The text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using 
any ASCII or UTF-8 capable text editor.  "Self-describing" means the file 
includes enough information about the included data (called metadata) 
that no additional file is required to understand the structure of the data 
and how to read and use the data.  Note that some non-ASCII characters (accents,
international character sets) may be present in various names and contact 
information.  These may require a UTF-8 capable text editor to view properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - CONTENT

See individual files for description of the provided variables and other 
dataset metadata.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 DATA - QC FLAGS 

NOAA GML uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.6 DATA - COLLECTION METHODS

A single-character code is used to identify the sample collection method.
The codes are:
    A - The automated or manual filling of a whole air sample using the
Programmable Flask Package (PFP) and Programmable Compressor Package (PCP)air
sampling devices. The air sample is contained in a 0.7 liter borosilicate
glass container (flask) fitted with two Glass Expansion high vacuum glass
piston valves sealed with PTFE O-rings. The flasks are typically flushed with
10 liters (aircraft samples) or 75 liters (tower samples) of ambient air and
then pressurized to 40 psia. Air is delivered through an intake tube using
two diaphragm pumps connected in series and controlled with a microprocessor.
The flow rate is approximately 15 L/min at sea level.  See Sweeney et al.
2015 and Andrews et al. 2014 for more details.
    C - Air samples are collected as with method ‘A’, but the sample air is
dried before sample collection. Flasks are not pre-filled with ambient air
before flushing and collecting  the air sample.
    R - Air samples are collected as with method 'A', but with an additional
glass conditioning step known as “prefilling”. During prefilling,  the glass
containers are flushed and filled with ambient air and then vented and
flushed immediately before air sample collection. This is a glass
conditioning step that addresses glass wall effects of the gasses of interest
(Andrews et al. 2014).
    B - Air samples are collected as with method ‘R’, but with an additional
drying step  using one of several techniques. In one method, e.g. site=ACT,
air samples were dried with a two-stage chiller cooled to 5 degrees C; those
taken below 3000 m MSL were also pressurized to 40 psia to further facilitate
air sample drying (Baier et al. 2019). At tower sampling sites, M&amp;C chillers
with temperatures set to approximately 3 degrees C and sub-ambient pressure
due to high flow are used (Andrew et al. 2014). At CRV tower, a two-stage
chiller set to -26 degrees C is used.
